   ```bash
   python cleanup_to_bin.py list
   ```

2. **Restore from Bin**
   ```bash
   python cleanup_to_bin.py restore filename_with_timestamp
   ```

3. **Check Git History**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   git checkout <commit_hash> -- filename
   ```

4. **Restore from Backup**
   ```bash
   Copy-Item "backup_*/filename" "."
   ```

### **If Database is Corrupted:**

1. **Check Instance Folder**
   ```bash
   if (Test-Path "instance/pdf_tool.db") {
       Copy-Item "instance/pdf_tool.db" "pdf_tool.db"
   }
   ```

2. **Recreate Database**
   ```bash
   Remove-Item "pdf_tool.db"
   python app.py
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations for New Features

When implementing the features described in `to_do.txt`, please consider the following security implications:

### 1. Proactive Document Assistance & Intelligence

#### Smart Document Hub / Dashboard

**Security Considerations:**
- **File Processing Security**: The PDF processing workflow uses Celery for asynchronous task execution. Ensure tasks are properly isolated and don't expose sensitive data between different user files.
- **Model Security**: The MLflow model used for classification should be secured against model inversion attacks that could reveal training data.
- **spaCy Entity Extraction**: The entity extraction process may identify sensitive information (names, addresses, etc.). Ensure proper handling and storage of extracted entities.
- **Error Handling**: The improved error handling should not leak sensitive system information in error messages returned to users.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Validate file types before processing (PDF only)
- [ ] Implement proper input sanitization for file names and metadata
- [ ] Ensure extracted entities are stored securely if persisted
- [ ] Limit processing time to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for processed document metadata

### 2. Hyper-Personalization and Customization

#### Personalized Workflows

**Security Considerations:**
- **User Data Privacy**: The workflow analysis tracks user command sequences, which may reveal sensitive usage patterns.
- **Data Aggregation**: Grouping user actions into workflows could inadvertently expose information about multiple users if not properly isolated.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Ensure workflow data is properly isolated between users
- [ ] Implement data retention policies for workflow analytics
- [ ] Avoid storing sensitive command parameters in workflow data
- [ ] Limit the number of historical records analyzed for performance and security

### 3. Business Intelligence and Data Analytics

#### Cross-Document Analysis

**Security Considerations:**
- **Multi-Document Processing**: Processing multiple documents together increases the risk of data leakage between documents belonging to different users.
- **GPU Resource Usage**: GPU-accelerated processing may introduce new attack vectors if not properly secured.
- **LLM Integration**: Using large language models introduces risks of prompt injection and data leakage.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Ensure strict document isolation during multi-document processing
- [ ] Validate all user inputs to prevent prompt injection attacks
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for cross-document analysis features
- [ ] Monitor GPU resource usage to prevent denial of service
- [ ] Limit the number of documents that can be processed together

### 4. Platform Ecosystem and Integrations

#### Cloud Storage Integration

**Security Considerations:**
- **OAuth Token Security**: Google Drive integration uses OAuth tokens that must be securely stored and refreshed.
- **Third-Party Data Access**: Accessing user files from cloud storage increases the attack surface.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Securely store OAuth tokens (encrypt at rest)
- [ ] Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Limit permissions to only necessary scopes
- [ ] Validate file types after downloading from cloud storage
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for cloud storage operations

#### Zapier and Make (Integromat) Integration

**Security Considerations:**
- **Webhook Security**: Webhook URLs may expose internal processing information to external systems.
- **Data Exposure**: Sending file processing results to external systems increases data exposure risk.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Validate webhook URLs before sending data
- [ ] Implement webhook authentication (HMAC signatures)
- [ ] Limit the amount of data sent in webhook payloads
- [ ] Implement retry limits and exponential backoff for webhook delivery

### 5. Advanced User and Team Management

#### Team Workspaces and RBAC

**Security Considerations:**
- **Access Control**: Team-based file sharing requires careful implementation of role-based access controls.
- **Data Isolation**: Files shared between team members must be properly isolated from other teams.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Implement proper role-based access controls
- [ ] Ensure team membership changes are properly validated
- [ ] Audit file access within team workspaces
- [ ] Implement proper file ownership and permission inheritance

### 6. Accessibility and Internationalization (i18n)

#### Multi-Language Support

**Security Considerations:**
- **Translation Security**: External translation libraries may introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Text Injection**: Multi-language support increases the risk of text injection attacks.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Validate all translated content before display
- [ ] Implement proper escaping for all user-facing text
- [ ] Audit third-party i18n libraries for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure language selection doesn't bypass access controls

#### Accessibility (a11y) Compliance

**Security Considerations:**
- **UI Manipulation**: Accessibility features that modify UI behavior could introduce new attack vectors.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Ensure accessibility features don't bypass security controls
- [ ] Validate keyboard navigation paths for security
- [ ] Implement proper focus management without exposing hidden elements

### 7. Performance and Cost Optimization at Scale

#### GPU-Accelerated AI Tasks

**Security Considerations:**
- **Resource Isolation**: GPU resources may not be properly isolated between different users or tasks.
- **Model Security**: AI models loaded for GPU acceleration may be targets for model extraction attacks.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Implement proper GPU resource isolation
- [ ] Monitor GPU usage for anomalies
- [ ] Secure AI models against extraction attacks
- [ ] Implement timeouts for GPU-accelerated tasks
